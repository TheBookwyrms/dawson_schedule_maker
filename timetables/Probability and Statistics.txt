    Benjamin Seamone
    Description
    The purpose of this course is to provide Science students foundational knowledge in probability and statistics, with the purpose of preparing them to perform basic statistical analysis. In the first part of the course, they will review the basics of descriptive statistics and data representation, along with an introduction to linear regression for bivariate data. In the second part, they will be introduced to the fundamental concepts and techniques of probability, including discrete and continuous probability distributions (binomial and normal distributions, in particular). In the third part of the course, they will be introduced to inferential statistics, which revolves around the central limit theorem; in this part they will learn how to estimate population parameters using confidence intervals, along with various types of hypothesis testing, including the variable independence chi-square test for contingency tables.
