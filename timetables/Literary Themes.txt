    The Red and the Black
    Section
    00001
    Teacher
    Paul Hawkins
    Description
    Often considered among the greatest novels ever written, The Red and the Black — the one major book we’ll read -- is a phenomenal introduction to the art and themes of the novel and the works of one of the world’s great writers, French novelist Stendhal. It's the story of a young man making his way in the world in early-19th century France; there's some love, there's some tragedy. The novel is a brick – 500 pages (approx.). Students should be prepared for a reading challenge. But if you put in the effort, it becomes a page-turner, and reading it can be a memorable life experience. We will read the novel in English translation, but students will be encouraged to read at least some excerpts in French (this course thus complements those courses that prepare students for the French Exit Test).

    20th Century Themes: Displaced Persons
    Section
    00004
    Teacher
    George Slobodzian
    Description
    The 20th century brought change in many forms, and with change comes displacement. In this course we look at various works of literature from the 20th century that involve some form of displacement — be it physical, psychological, technological, social or cultural. While the main focus of the course will be the development of close readings and thematic interpretations of these texts, which will include poems, short stories and a novel, we will also consider the historical contexts out of which the texts were generated. In this way, the course helps us understand how 20th century literature can be seen as both a response to displacement and an effort to find a new place in the challenging new world we find ourselves in now.

    Section

    Teacher
    Wendy Thatcher
    Description
    In this course, we will be examining literature that focuses on the environment and the complicated relationship between humans and the natural world. While nature has sustained humanity, we have not given back, leading to the current environmental crises we are experiencing. Most of the works we read will be from the twentieth century onwards, but we will take the occasional look back in time. We will be reading some poems, short stories and a novel, but most of the readings will be selections from memoirs and essays. The writers – people like Alice Munro, T.C. Boyle, Richard Powers, Hope Jahren, Roger Deakin, Bill McGibben, J. B. MacKinnon, Elizabeth Kolbert, Jonathan Franzen – will take us through gardens, dirt, trees, forests, waterways and wild places. We will be introduced to travellers, conservationists, ecoterrorists, loggers and people like ourselves. Through these landscapes, literary and real, we will come to understand some of the major challenges facing the earth today.

    Jealousy, justice, revenge, hubris, and fate — in other words, the world of Ancient Greek drama. This course will pair the seminal Ancient Greek plays of Sophocles and Euripides with modern and contemporary adaptations to see how the concerns of those who came before us echo in our world today. Our reading of each Greek play will be followed by the adaptation, allowing us a framework for understanding the enduring themes in more current contexts.

    This course examines short fiction, essays, and novels depicting the experiences of immigrants. We will focus on contemporary fiction exploring the lives of newcomers from places such as Latin America, South-East Asia, and the former Soviet Union. The course pursues questions of cultural adaptation, generational conflict, marginalization, racism, and the abiding dreams of political freedom and economic success in a new society. It necessarily involves some consideration of the history of immigration patterns — the forces that have induced or obliged people to migrate, the nature of the societies they leave behind, the policies and attitudes that greet them in their new countries.

    Being Blitzed: British Literature of WWII
    Section
    00013
    Teacher
    Robin E. Feenstra
    Description
    This course explores the various representations of the Second World War in British literature. While the focus falls on the literature of the blitz, many other thematic preoccupations (borders, propaganda, patriotism, love, the domestic and the foreign, the public and the private, reconstruction and damage) emerge that speak to the wide variety of writings and perspectives on the war. The Second World War was the most momentous set of events in the twentieth century, and inspired a wealth of writing: factual and fictional texts that explore an immense range of experiences. In addition to conveying different aspects of the war’s actuality, these works also raise important questions about the relation of art to life, the relationship between the individual and the nation or state, the role of women in otherwise male-dominated narratives of war, and about politics and culture. Course readings include poems, stories, essays, radio broadcasts, documentary/feature films, and a short novel.

    Merrianne Couture
    Description
    How do comics tell the stories of those who cross borders, flee violence, or search for home? This course explores the powerful intersection of visual storytelling and human movement, examining how graphic narratives—memoirs, reportage, and fictionalized accounts—depict the lived experiences of migration and displacement. From refugee journeys and asylum struggles to the politics of borders and identity, students will engage with diverse works by artists from across the globe who use the comic form to challenge dominant narratives, humanize statistics, and amplify marginalized voices. Through close readings, critical discussions, and visual analysis, we will investigate how image and text work together to represent trauma, resilience, and belonging. This course invites students to think across disciplines—literature, human rights, political geography, and visual culture—while asking, What can graphic narratives reveal about the global condition of displacement?

    Louise Slater
    Description
    Reading a good novel is a life-expanding and life-enhancing experience. In this course we will read three, each with a different focus. Possibilities include aspects of Canadian Indigenous experience; life in the near future; Black American experience; and contemporary women's experience. Within these larger contexts, several themes appear: questions of love, family, humanity, technology, heroism, self-knowledge, sacrifice, betrayal, monsters, magic, responsibility, and more. As long-form fiction, novels allow us a sustained and often deeper access to identities and experiences we may otherwise never know. They also connect us more deeply to ourselves. This course has a significant reading load, because that’s how novels roll.

    Augustan Satire, 1660-1745
    Section

    Teacher
    David Gelineau
    Description
    This course will examine themes of the satirists of the Augustan period. Through an examination of the work of Swift, Wycherley, and Pope, we will see how and why these satirists reacted with moral outrage to the encroaching of what has become the modern world, with its love of individualism, democracy, business, and science. The course will limit itself to the genre of satire in the period; so the study of that genre and its history, as well as the study of the broader historical period and the cultural context these authors were writing in, will be our concern.

    Metamorphoses in Literature
    Section

    Teacher
    Liana Bellon
    Description
    Webster’s Dictionary defines “metamorphosis” as “a transformation, as by magic or sorcery” or as “a marked change in appearance, character, condition, or function.” As we will see, writers and artists throughout the centuries have been fascinated by the theme of physical and psychological change. Beginning with the ancient Roman poet Ovid’s collection of poems, written in 1 C.E. and entitled the Metamorphoses, we will analyze how this recurring theme is explored in Shakespeare’s Othello, Shaw’s Pygmalion, Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. Towards the end of term, we will read Neil LaBute’s play The Shape of Things, which is the culmination of our course’s theme since it includes many references and allusions to the transformations explored in the works above.

    Time Travel in Literature
    Section
    00019
    Teacher
    Todd Starke-Meyerring
    Description
    Although predominantly considered a theme of science fiction, the concept of time travel has popularity beyond the issues surrounding the scientific possibility of travelling in time itself, made theoretically possible by Einstein. Since time affects everyone, a wide spectrum of authors has explored what it might mean to travel in time, be it to the past or the future. But time travel is far more than simply about poking into the past to change something undesirable or popping into the future to have a peek at where things might be going. The device of travelling in time is more about the present and how we feel about it, usually that something could — and sometimes should — be changed to make life better. This course will explore how time travel — and time itself — is explored in a variety of texts.

    Utopia/Dystopia
    Section
    00021
    Teacher
    Ursula Misztal
    Description
    This course examines the theme of utopia/dystopia in literature and its evolution and metamorphosis into fantasy, science fiction and political satire. Beginning with Thomas More’s Utopia, we will consider what the word’ utopia’ means and look at some short fiction it has inspired from writers such as H.G. Wells, Joanna Russ, and others. We will then cross over the line to dystopia, utopia’s dark and cynical underside, and consider two longer contemporary works: George Orwell’s 1984 and Kurt Vonnegut’s Cat’s Cradle. At the conclusion of the course, we will try to determine why this theme resonates with many writers and provides inspiration for the building of fantastic imaginary worlds that are ultimately an extension of our own living dreams, while also unearthing nightmares that most immediately reveal our fear of our own time and place in history.

    Grief, Loss, and Magic

    Teacher
    Tijana Stojkovic
    Description
    “‘Tis better to have loved and lost/Than never to have loved at all.” (Tennyson) “Between grief and nothing, I will take grief.” (Faulkner) Losing something or someone important, and grieving that loss is a universal, unavoidable and formative human experience. The map of a lifetime can be traced through the intricate series of losses, small and big: we can lose other people, we can lose ideals, relationships, friendships, countries, identity, youth, dignity, freedom, beliefs, and all kinds of metaphoric battles. How do we deal with this? How do we grieve, do we talk about it, and how do we talk about it? What is it that allows Tennyson and Faulkner to proclaim the above confidently? What kinds of magic are humans capable of conjuring (and turning into a reality) in order to make sense of their losses? In this class, we’ll speculate on these and other questions with the help of a novella, a few short stories and poems, and a couple of films.

    This course will examine how the First World War (1914-1918) transformed Western society and played a significant role in shaping the culture, values, and geography of the modern world. After a brief introduction to the concept of warfare, students will move to an examination of the Great War’s literature — primarily poetry and excerpts from memoirs. The class will focus on how soldiers responded to the physical and psychological trauma of the War but will also examine writing by non-combatants to see how the effects of the War were felt well beyond its battlefields.

We will take as a starting point the feminist assumption that gender is socially constructed and that the meaning of sexual differences is never natural, essential, or self-evident, but is always a matter of (social) interpretation. We will be particularly interested in later writers of science fiction who, beginning in the 1960s, interrogate and challenge the male dominance of earlier examples of the genre and their (mis)representations of women and other sexual nonconformists including gay or bisexual men and women and transgender individuals. Key authors include Ursula K. LeGuin, James Tiptree Jr., Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, Octavia Butler, and John Varley, among others.

    Noah Weisberg
    Description
    This course will examine how the First World War (1914-1918) transformed Western society and played a significant role in shaping the culture, values, and geography of the modern world. After a brief introduction to the concept of warfare, students will move to an examination of the Great War’s literature — primarily poetry and excerpts from memoirs. The class will focus on how soldiers responded to the physical and psychological trauma of the War but will also examine writing by non-combatants to see how the effects of the War were felt well beyond its battlefields.

    Women with Agency
    Section
    00030
    Teacher
    Gina Granter
    Description
    To have agency is to be able to exert some control over one’s life: to be an active subject rather than a passive object. Women in patriarchal societies have historically been denied equal agency to that of men and still face barriers to fully realizing their goals for themselves, particularly if other factors such as racial prejudice, ableism, ageism, class discrimination, homophobia, and/or transphobia are involved. In this course students will explore a number of themes related to women asserting their agency, often against norms of their times and places. Novels, essays, and short stories by a diversity of women and nonbinary authors (included because they were assigned female at birth and discuss that experience) are among the course's required works. The relevance of historical and cultural context will be considered in our discussion of works in the course.

    Words of Love

    Teacher
    Brent Devine
    Description
    “Love” is among the most malleable words in the English language. We encounter the word on a near daily basis, but its definition is impossible to pin down. Love is at once universal and transcendent, and deeply personal and historical. This course, through the careful investigation of a range of texts from different genres and historical periods, asks you to contemplate diverse literary depictions of love and their consequences. We will consider the medieval romance and courtly love, the fairy tale and true love, queer literature and forbidden love. Students will be encouraged to understand, appreciate, and analyze works of literature, and to write critically about these works by developing their own ideas in the form of a literary essay. Class time will be divided between lectures, class discussions, group work, and in-class assignments. Assignments include reading quizzes, in-class brainstorming and writing exercises, homework (esp. reading), and major essays.

    Description
    Although Black Canadians are often considered to be only recent immigrants, we have been here since the early colonial era, contributing to the fabric of Canada. This thematic course shares works reflective of the Canadian experience of those of African and Afro-Caribbean descent since that time. It seeks to engage with history as well as art in genres as varied as poetry, biography, the novel, and documentary and fictional films. Topics to be covered include slavery, the world wars, postwar immigration, the 1968 Congress of Black Writers, and the 1969 Sir George Williams Protest. The objective is to give students an appreciation of Canadian citizenship from this perspective. Among the authors who works will be studied are Suzette Mayr, Cecil Foster, and H. Nigel Thomas.

    Being Blitzed: British Literature of WWII
    Section
    00034
    Teacher
    Robin E. Feenstra
    Description
    This course explores the various representations of the Second World War in British literature. While the focus falls on the literature of the blitz, many other thematic preoccupations (borders, propaganda, patriotism, love, the domestic and the foreign, the public and the private, reconstruction and damage) emerge that speak to the wide variety of writings and perspectives on the war. The Second World War was the most momentous set of events in the twentieth century, and inspired a wealth of writing: factual and fictional texts that explore an immense range of experiences. In addition to conveying different aspects of the war’s actuality, these works also raise important questions about the relation of art to life, the relationship between the individual and the nation or state, the role of women in otherwise male-dominated narratives of war, and about politics and culture. Course readings include poems, stories, essays, radio broadcasts, documentary/feature films, and a short novel.

    Description
    This course aims to initiate students to contemporary Quebecois literature. We will discuss how the literature we read (two novels and a few short stories) reflects the current realities of Quebecois society. Two threads that will run through all the texts we read are community and identity. How does the intersection of identity, language, and community inform our particular realities in Quebec? How can reading Quebecois literature give us greater insight into ourselves and those we pass on the street every day? A special feature of this course is that we will engage in frequent collaborative activities with students from a French course with a similar theme, titled "Voix croisées dans la littérature québécoise contemporaine.” The aim is opening ourselves to as many varied perspectives as possible.

    Liana Bellon
    Description
    Webster’s Dictionary defines “metamorphosis” as “a transformation, as by magic or sorcery” or as “a marked change in appearance, character, condition, or function.” As we will see, writers and artists throughout the centuries have been fascinated by the theme of physical and psychological change. Beginning with the ancient Roman poet Ovid’s collection of poems, written in 1 C.E. and entitled the Metamorphoses, we will analyze how this recurring theme is explored in Shakespeare’s Othello, Shaw’s Pygmalion, Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. Towards the end of term, we will read Neil LaBute’s play The Shape of Things, which is the culmination of our course’s theme since it includes many references and allusions to the transformations explored in the works above.

    Southern Stories: Themes in Fiction of the American South
    Section
    00039
    Teacher
    Pauline Morel
    Description
    Journey through the rich and often haunting landscapes of the American South in this exploration of fiction, autobiography and film. We’ll examine how Southern writers and filmmakers portray the region’s distinct dialects, oral traditions, and cultural history—from slavery and segregation to social movements and the emergence of diverse, intersectional “Souths” that challenge the idea of a single Southern identity. These include Souths that are urban, queer, undead, activist, Indigenous, and surreal. We'll explore themes such as the burden of the past, family and community ties, systemic racism, violence, religious faith, humour, and the gothic and grotesque. The course also introduces key literary techniques—stream of consciousness, shifting points of view, unreliable narrators, allegory, irony, horror, fragmentation, and juxtaposition—as ways of expressing deep connections to, and questions about, identity, memory, and the shifting Southern landscape.

    Through a careful examination of selected works, this course delves into the intricacies of horror storytelling, uncovering the psychological, emotional, and societal fears that permeate the genre. Through an in-depth exploration of the novel form, we will uncover the psychological, social, and cultural factors that transform common lives into disturbing tales of moral descent. Examining contemporary horror literature, students will analyze how authors portray the shadow side of humanity, reflecting on themes such as guilt, ambition and vengeance, entitlement, and power. These readings demonstrate the potential for malevolence in the most unlikely places. Ultimately, these narratives challenge our understanding of human nature and in all its complexity. Students will engage with primary texts, secondary scholarship, and multimedia resources. Class time will be devoted to discussions, writing workshops, group work and lectures, oral presentations, and various written compositions.

    Year Zero: Writing Around Punk Rock
    Section
    00042
    Teacher
    Andrew Williams
    Description
    In the 1970’s Britain was a bleak place for many, especially for the young. Unemployment was high, there seemed to be no hope. Your choices, particularly if you were of the working class, were largely (and perhaps stereotypically), unemployment, the army or a factory job; at least, so it seemed to many. This is the framework of Punk Rock, a musical movement and, in Britain particularly, a social movement as well. This course will explore a variety of writing around this movement. Starting with 1976 (and a little before) and moving to 1978 (and a little after) we will investigate a selection of lyrics, videos, essays, journalism, biography and other fiction and nonfiction work in an attempt to define the movement and examine the resonance which is still felt to this day. Topics to be covered (amongst others) deal with questions of class, income equality, educational opportunities, race, gender discrimination, lgbqia2+ inclusion, and DIY philosophy.

    Description
    This course uses critical theory and fictional stories to investigate what drives people's behaviours and shapes their psychology. We read fictional stories that raise thematic issues such as capitalism, sex and death in conjunction with scholarly texts that explain Marxist, Freudian, and Lacanian methods of analysis. The application of Marxist, Freudian and Lacanian literary theory informs our close reading of Canadian and English literature, and guides our interpretation of underlying figurative meaning. Using these social and psychoanalytic literary theories, we examine what motivates people to make seemingly irrational and self-destructive decisions despite the damaging consequences—whether these motivations come from desire externally rooted in preexisting social structures or are internally rooted in the unconscious.

    Gods and monsters haunt our collective psyche—and thus our art and literature. The enduring fascination we have with these creatures, monstrous or glorious, stems from how much they speak to our own nature—the parts we are most proud—and most wary—of investigating. The core aim of the class is to investigate and analyze stories about monsters, gods and mythology as jumping-off points to ponder, analyze, and discuss current issues and what they - and our enduring love for them - can tell us about ourselves and the world we live in. Students will read stories and plays by Shelley, Stoker, Dear, Barker, Green, and Buehlman. The class is heavily built around group work and creative projects.

    Andrew Katz
    Description
    In this course, we will read a wide range of texts, from fairy tales to contemporary children’s literary texts. In addition, through discussion and writing, students will develop skills in 1) thinking about and responding to children’s literature, 2) articulating their personal views and values, and 3) making a formal analysis of literary texts. Students will also have the opportunity to experiment with writing about their own experience as children and writing their own texts for children. A variety of methods will be used to engage students in critical reading, discussion and writing. Included among these methods will be short lectures, video presentations and discussion, small group and class discussions of readings, and individual and group writing projects and oral presentations. Students should be prepared to work in small groups. Some writing assignments will be completed during class time.

    Description
    Is there already an alien intelligence among us, restructuring how we learn, reshaping our society, and reshaping our conception of the self? Is the landscape of our work and how we assign value shifting under our feet? How will artificial intelligence change the world and humanity? Like ancient navigators reading the signs of the coming weather in the sky or modern seismologists measuring the likelihood of an earthquake, in this class we will glean what we can from novels, poems, movies, and television about what might happen soon. Together we will look at the work of social historians, economists, and journalists as they project the impact AI will have on society. This constellation of texts charts the possibilities of how AI might reconfigure both society and notions of a human soul. We may be left with more questions than answers, but the process will help clarify what makes us human.
