    Teacher
    John Hunting
    Description
    This course examines how we relate to others and how we ought to relate to others. The distinction between ethos (world views) and ta ethika (fields and problems of knowledge) proves central to the inquiry into what it means to not only feel the weight of socially determined notions of what is good but to also feel the weight of universal obligations. Thus the course begins with sociological descriptions of self and other and it turns to traditional ethical theories about justice and the good, theories such as utilitarianism, Kant’s categorical imperative and the ethics of care. These ethical theories in mind students present and debate various ethical issues, including euthanasia, capital punishment, abortion, pornography, poverty, animal rights, global warming and others.

    Description
    In this course we will examine both the ethics of how individual human beings should act towards one another, and what sort of rules and behaviour citizens of a state (in this case, Canada) should agree to follow and impose on each other. We will begin by examining different ethical theories, including but not limited to the Divine Command Theory, the Social Contract Theory, the Categorical Imperative, Utilitarianism and Relativism. After studying, understanding and critiquing these different approaches to ethics, we will apply our knowledge to an issue of perpetual importance: the balance between individual liberties and group security. This part of the course will include readings and discussions of issues such as online surveillance and data collection, torture and the imposition of the War Measures Act during the October Crisis of 1970.

    Description
    This course addresses two extremes of human behavior by examining our responses, both individual and collective, to human brutality – our desire for vengeance and punishment, our search for acknowledgment and justice, and the possibility for remorse, forgiveness and reconciliation. Students will be asked to consider their ethical responsibilities towards both victims and perpetrators, to righting old wrongs, and to reflect on how a concern with human suffering is relevant to their own field of study.

    Section
    00015
    Teacher
    Maia Stepenberg
    Description
    This Ethics course examines the Christian revolution in understanding the world and modern man's place in it. That revolution may be said to have begun with Dante Alighieri and his monumental poem The Divine Comedy (1321). This one encyclopedic text, which represents the finest flowering of the medieval age in Europe, was conceived by Dante as "the new epic of Christendom," a journey through Hell and Purgatory and Paradise that was designed to bring readers from a state of misery to one of happiness. By acquainting themselves with substantial selections from "history's greatest poem," students will acquire a direct understanding of Dante's medieval view of ethics, as well as some still older moral foundations as defined by Aristotle. Students will also be exposed to some contemporary commentaries on Dante's continued relevance to modern life. Students will thus learn to appreciate the medieval world of ideas and values in relation to their own knowledge and experience of modernity.

    Buddhist Ethics
    Section

    Teacher
    Julian Nemeth
    Description
    Approximately 2500 years ago, Siddhartha Gautama Shakyamuni developed teaching centered on understanding and ending suffering. This teaching served as the foundation of Buddhism, one of the most influential religious and philosophical traditions in world history. In this class, we will examine the foundations of Buddhist ethics; explore multiple lines of Buddhist thought; and compare Buddhist moral philosophy with "Western" approaches such as Kantianism and Utilitarianism. The course also surveys recent movements in "engaged Buddhism," examining how the tradition has been applied to issues such as environmental justice, anti-racism, and conflict resolution. We will also study instances where Buddhists have not always lived up to their teachings' lofty goals, considering how ideals and actualities sometimes clash. Finally, we will engage in meditation inspired by Buddhist practice--but open to those of all world views—to help understand how ethics may be supported by mindfulness.

    The Universe on Your Plate
    Section
    00023
    Teacher
    Daniel Goldsmith
    Description
    Many of us do not consider that we are making an ethical choice at every meal. We do not often realize that our food decisions have enormous consequences for the environment, the people who grow and process our food, and our health. All of these factors are important to consider if we want to determine the most ethical way to eat. This course is designed to give you a basis for making ethical choices at your dinner (and lunch, and breakfast) table. During the first part of the course, we will examine several ethical theories, including utilitarianism, deontology, and Buddhist ethics. We will also consider whether our understanding of the universe, specifically that the atoms in our food and our bodies were forged in the bellies of exploding stars, could inform our ethical choices. In the second part of the course, we will go over many of the facts about the industrial food system, and apply the ethical theories we’ve learned.

    Applied Ethics: On Having Hard Conversations (with New School)
    Section
    14001
    Teacher
    Cory Legassic
    Description
    In this New School applied ethics course, we engage with concepts, theories, and models from a variety of disciplines to help us explore a pressing question: What are ethical considerations and approaches that can support our choices for engaging in difficult dialogue? Instead of looking for what is best/right/perfect in our disagreements, let’s explore conditions and methods for having hard conversations that are generative, creative, challenging, and nurturing of growth. New School’s critical humanistic education approach is grounded in three values: the facilitation of learning (rather than teaching), self-to-subject (drawing on the wisdom in the diversity of experience in the learning community), and emerging curriculum (providing a responsive structure with flexibility of content with students as co-designers and collaborators of learning).
